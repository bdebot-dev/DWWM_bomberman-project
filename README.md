# Bomberman-like JavaScript Game

This project is a simple, browser-based Bomberman-like game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Two players can move their characters around a grid-based playground:  
- The **red player** is controlled with the arrow keys.  
- The **blue player** is controlled with the ZQSD keys.

The game is designed as a foundation for further development, such as adding bombs, obstacles, scoring, and more advanced gameplay mechanics. The code is cleanly organized with a clear separation between structure (HTML), style (CSS), and logic (JavaScript), making it easy to extend and customize.

## Features:
- Two-player movement on a fixed grid
- Distinct controls for each player
- Responsive and smooth movement animations
- Easily customizable and extendable codebase

> Feel free to fork the project and add your own Bomberman-inspired features!
